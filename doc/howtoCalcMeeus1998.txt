     The following are taken from studying Meeus, Jean Astronomical algorithms second edition 1998, ISBN 0-943396-61-1.
     This document is part of my sp project where I aim to calculate the Suns position in a command line utility using c++.

In the introduction, Meeus says:
	...in order to create a program for the calculation of the altitude of the Sun for a given time on a given 
	date at a given place, one must first convert the date and time to Julian Day (Chapter 7), then calculate 
	the Sun’s longitude for that instant (Chapter 25), its right ascension and declination (Chapter 13), the 
	sidereal time (Chapter 12) and finally the required altitude of the Sun (Chapter 13).

Following these instruction I will create a software model that gives me the Sun’s position for a given time, 
on a given date at a given place.
